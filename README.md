#### Data : Loan Data from Prosper, year 2005 - 2014

From the analysis done on prosper loan data, it is seen that;

•	Most loan listings were created during working hours. We see a trend increasing from the early mornings and decline towards late evenings.

•	We see that 77.04% of all the loan listings belong to the 36 month duration category.

•	There is correlation between LoanOriginalAmount and MonthlyLoanPayment, borrowers with shorter loan terms tend to have a higher MonthlyLoanPayment.

#### Feedback

•	I shoul describe my words more so that my reader can know what am saying, e.g. listing should be more understood saying Loan listing.

•	The message was well passed across. (After the first correction was affected).
